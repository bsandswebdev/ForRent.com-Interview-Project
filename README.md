# ForRent.com-Interview-Project
Tasked to complete this project as part of a Jr. Web Developer position interview.

<h2>Exercise Rules:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript can only be used for setTimeout and adding CSS classes.</li>
	<li>Do not use any JavaScript DOM libraries (jQuery, Prototype, Mootools, etc.) since you are only doing simple tasks.  You may use RequireJS (http://requirejs.org/) and/or Grunt if you want to impress.</li>
	<li>All animations will be done in CSS3</li>
	<li>HTML should validate against HTML5 doctype</li>
	<li>All elements must be completely fluid, scaling to a minimum browser width of 320 pixels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Details:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The page should initially be shown, wait 3 seconds and then display the overlay.  After 5 seconds, the overlay should disappear.</li>
	<li>The overlay content (white box with text) will slide in from the right hand side of the page.</li>
	<li>It is definitely a bonus if you utilize Grunt (for any tasks pertinent to the exercise - http://gruntjs.com/).</li>
	<li>Please do not use tables.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Notes From Author:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>&#42;&#42;This was all mocked up and coded based on "Example-1.psd"&#42;&#42;</li>
	<li>This was a really interesting and different project!, and I really enjoyed working on this! It was a great exercise to work through. I hope to speak with you further about this position, and I know if given the opportunity I can do an excellent job!</li>
	<li>I Initially wanted to get going on this project, as to make sure I completed it on time, and I worked through the project utilizing a gulp.js file/workflow which I had previously created a couple of weeks ago.</li> 
	<li>I know gulp.js very similar to grunt.js and that it can do all the same tasks as grunt. I feel confident I can work with grunt.js just as easily as with gulp.js as they are both cmd line based and do the same sort of tasks. I plan on making a grunt.js file this weekend that does all the same tasks that I utilized in gulp.js and will add it to this repository! </li>
	<li>This was my first time using github, and I know there is also integration with github and grunt.js/gulp.js which I plan on digging into as well.</li>
	<li>I am eager to learn more and kudos to whoever thought up this project!</li> 
	<li>See links below to updated Grunt and Gulp files. I also modified the gulp.js file currently in this repository to save to a new file (theme.min.css) when minifying instead of overwriting the theme.css file.</li>
