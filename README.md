# ForRent.com-Interview-Project
Tasked to complete this project as part of a Jr. Web Developer position interview.

<h2>Exercise Rules:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript can only be used for setTimeout and adding CSS classes.</li>
	<li>Do not use any JavaScript DOM libraries (jQuery, Prototype, Mootools, etc.) since you are only doing simple tasks.  You may use RequireJS (http://requirejs.org/) and/or Grunt if you want to impress.</li>
	<li>All animations will be done in CSS3</li>
	<li>HTML should validate against HTML5 doctype</li>
	<li>All elements must be completely fluid, scaling to a minimum browser width of 320 pixels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Details:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The page should initially be shown, wait 3 seconds and then display the overlay.  After 5 seconds, the overlay should disappear.</li>
	<li>The overlay content (white box with text) will slide in from the right hand side of the page.</li>
	<li>It is definitely a bonus if you utilize Grunt (for any tasks pertinent to the exercise - http://gruntjs.com/).</li>
	<li>Please do not use tables.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Notes From Author:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>&#42;&#42;This was all mocked up and coded based on "Example-1.psd"&#42;&#42;</li>
	<li>This was a really interesting and different project!, and I really enjoyed working on this! It was a great exercise to work through.</li>
	<li>The project instructions said to use Grunt. I had started using Gulp a few weeks prior to tstarting this, so I used that to quickly get going on this project. After the project was due I also made a grunt.js the performed the same tasks I used in gulp.
	<li>See links below to updated Grunt and Gulp files. 
</ul>
